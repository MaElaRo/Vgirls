          The outer labia are cut and sewn together to create a seal over the
          urethra and the vagina. This procedure can be done with removing the
          clitoris and inner labia, or without. Especially this procedure has a
          risk for ongoing infections, because the urine and menstrual fluid
          canâ€™t pass the hole. To have sexual intercourse or to give birth, a
          lot of women need to be cut open again.
